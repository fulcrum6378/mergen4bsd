## Mergen4BSD

Forked from [**MergenLinux**](https://github.com/fulcrum6378/mergen_linux) at 12 November 2023, 04:04,
as a subproject of [**Mergen IV**](https://github.com/fulcrum6378/mergen_android).

### Compilation

/mergen # `make`

### Execution

This is a mere command-line program. As soon as the program starts,
recording from first detected webcam, microphone and touchpad will begin.
The main thread listens if you press the Enter button; then it will stop recording.

/mergen # `build/Mergen`

### Dependencies
